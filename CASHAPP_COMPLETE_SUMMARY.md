## Key Fixes Applied

### ✅ CORS Error (FIXED)
**Problem**: Browser CORS preflight error when calling Edge Function  
**Root Cause**: OPTIONS response missing status code  
**Solution**: Changed from:
```typescript
return new Response("ok", { headers: cors });
```
To:
```typescript
return new Response("ok", { status: 200, headers: cors });
```

---

## Testing Quick Start

### 1. Run CORS Tests
```bash
node test-manual-orders.js
```
Expected: All 7 tests pass ✅

### 2. Manual User Test
1. Open app (WatchPage or LivePage)
2. Click "Get Coins"
3. Click "📱 Cash App" tab
4. Select a package
5. Click "Send via Cash App"
6. Verify 3-step modal appears
7. Click "Done - I'll Verify"
8. Verify success message shows order ID

### 3. Manual Admin Test
1. As admin, go to Admin Dashboard
2. Click "Manual Orders" tab
3. Should see pending order from user
4. Verify user details show correctly
5. Click "Mark Paid & Credit Coins"
6. Verify status changes to FULFILLED
7. Verify user's coin balance increased

---

## Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Deploy Edge Function
```bash
cd your-project
supabase functions deploy manual-coin-order
```

### Step 2: Verify Deployment
```bash
supabase functions logs manual-coin-order --tail
```
Watch for "Server running" message

### Step 3: Test Endpoint
```bash
npm run test:manual-orders
```
Should pass all 7 tests

### Step 4: Test in Browser
Follow "Manual User Test" above

### Step 5: Announce to Users
Update UI/docs to show Cash App is now available as payment option

---

## Quick Reference for Operations

### View Pending Orders
```sql
SELECT * FROM manual_coin_orders WHERE status = 'pending' ORDER BY created_at DESC;
```

### View Today's Approved Orders
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) as count, SUM(coins) as total_coins
FROM manual_coin_orders
WHERE status = 'fulfilled' AND DATE(fulfilled_at) = TODAY();
```

### Check User's Coin Balance
```sql
SELECT username, troll_coins FROM user_profiles WHERE id = 'user-id';
```

### Monitor Errors
```bash
supabase functions logs manual-coin-order --tail
```

---

## Common Tasks

### Task: Find Pending Orders
**Command**: Go to Admin Dashboard → Manual Orders → Filter "Pending"

### Task: Approve an Order
**Steps**:
1. Go to Admin Dashboard → Manual Orders
2. Find the order
3. Verify Cash App payment exists
4. Enter TX ID (optional)
5. Click "Mark Paid & Credit"

### Task: Check Order Status
**Command**:
```sql
SELECT id, status, created_at, fulfilled_at FROM manual_coin_orders WHERE id = 'order-id';
```

### Task: Debug CORS Error
**Check**:
1. Is Edge Function deployed? `supabase functions list`
2. Does it have OPTIONS handler? Look at index.ts line 19
3. Does OPTIONS return 200? Run test-manual-orders.js test #1

---

## Troubleshooting

### Problem: Button doesn't work
**Solution**: Check browser console for errors, verify auth token is valid

### Problem: Order won't appear in dashboard
**Solution**: Check RLS policies are enabled, verify admin role in database

### Problem: Coins not credited
**Solution**: Check approve_manual_order RPC exists, verify status is 'pending'

### Problem: CORS error
**Solution**: Redeploy Edge Function with `supabase functions deploy manual-coin-order`
