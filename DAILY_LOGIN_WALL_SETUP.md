# 🚀 Daily Login Wall - Setup Instructions

## Quick Start (5 Minutes)

### Step 1: Apply Database Migration
1. Go to your **Supabase Dashboard** → SQL Editor
2. Open and run the file: `add_daily_login_posts.sql`
3. This creates:
   - `daily_login_posts` table for tracking posts
   - Database functions for RPC calls
   - RLS security policies
   - Necessary indexes

### Step 2: Deploy Code
Code is already in place:
- ✅ `src/components/trollWall/DailyLoginWall.tsx` - User interface component
- ✅ `src/lib/hooks/useDailyLoginPost.ts` - Business logic hook
- ✅ `src/pages/TrollCityWall.tsx` - Wall page integration
- ✅ `src/pages/Home.tsx` - Home page feature card

### Step 3: Test the Feature
1. Start your dev server: `npm run dev`
2. Navigate to `/wall` (Troll City Wall page)
3. You should see the **Daily Login Wall** section at the top
4. Try posting to earn coins!

## ✅ What You'll See

### Daily Login Wall Component
```
┌─ Daily Login Post ┐
│ Post once daily to earn 0-100 Troll Coins
│ [textarea: What's on your mind? _______________]
│ Characters: 23/500
│ [Post & Earn Coins] (shows +47 🪙 on hover)
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### After Posting
```
✅ Great! You already posted today. Come back tomorrow!
```

---

## 💰 How It Works

1. **User writes a post** → Max 500 characters
2. **Clicks "Post & Earn Coins"** → Random coins generated (0-100)
3. **Post created & coins awarded** → Toast notification shows amount
4. **Daily limit enforced** → Cannot post again until tomorrow (UTC)
5. **Profile updated** → Coins show in player stats

---

## 🔍 Verification

### Check Database
```sql
-- See today's posts
SELECT user_id, coins_earned, posted_at 
FROM daily_login_posts 
WHERE DATE(posted_at) = CURRENT_DATE
ORDER BY posted_at DESC;

-- See how many posts a user has made
SELECT user_id, COUNT(*) as total_posts, SUM(coins_earned) as total_coins
FROM daily_login_posts
GROUP BY user_id
ORDER BY total_posts DESC;
```

### Check in Application
1. Navigate to `/wall`
2. View the Daily Login Wall section
3. Try to post if you haven't today
4. Check your coin balance increases in Stats page

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "Daily Login Wall component not showing"
- Verify SQL migration was applied successfully
- Check browser console for errors
- Ensure you're logged in
- Clear browser cache and reload

### "Coins not being awarded"
- Check Supabase SQL Editor for RPC function errors
- Verify `user_profiles` table has `troll_coins` column
- Check browser console for API errors
- Ensure user has authentication token

### "Can post multiple times per day"
- SQL migration may not have applied UNIQUE constraint
- Check `daily_login_posts` table structure
- Re-run SQL migration
- Clear and try again next UTC day

### "Styling looks wrong"
- Verify Tailwind CSS is configured
- Check no CSS conflicts with other components
- Clear `.next` or build cache
- Rebuild: `npm run build`

## 📊 Monitoring

### Daily Active Users
```sql
SELECT 
  DATE(posted_at) as date,
  COUNT(DISTINCT user_id) as active_users
FROM daily_login_posts
GROUP BY DATE(posted_at)
ORDER BY date DESC
LIMIT 30;
```

### Coin Distribution
```sql
SELECT 
  DATE(posted_at) as date,
  COUNT(*) as posts,
  AVG(coins_earned) as avg_coins,
  MIN(coins_earned) as min_coins,
  MAX(coins_earned) as max_coins,
  SUM(coins_earned) as total_coins
FROM daily_login_posts
GROUP BY DATE(posted_at)
ORDER BY date DESC;
```

### User Streaks
```sql
SELECT 
  user_id,
  (SELECT username FROM user_profiles WHERE id = daily_login_posts.user_id) as username,
  COUNT(DISTINCT DATE(posted_at)) as days_posted,
  SUM(coins_earned) as total_coins_earned,
  MAX(posted_at) as last_post
FROM daily_login_posts
GROUP BY user_id
ORDER BY days_posted DESC
LIMIT 20;
```

## 🔐 Security Notes

- ✅ **RLS Enabled**: Users can only see their own daily posts
- ✅ **Rate Limiting**: Database UNIQUE constraint prevents duplicate posts
- ✅ **Validation**: Server-side validation on coins (0-100)
- ✅ **Authentication**: Functions require authenticated user
- ✅ **SQL Injection**: Parameterized queries via Supabase RPC
- ✅ **Timezone Safe**: Uses UTC for consistency
