# Cash App Manual Coin Order System

## Overview
This document explains the Cash App payment flow for purchasing coins through manual verification by Admin and Secretary roles.

## User Flow

### 1. User Initiates Cash App Payment
- User opens **Coin Store Modal** (any page with coins)
- Selects coin package
- Clicks "💳 Card" or "📱 Cash App" tab to switch payment method
- Clicks "Send via Cash App" button
- **CashAppPaymentModal** opens

### 2. Payment Request Creation
- User sees payment instructions:
  - **Cash App**: $trollcity95
  - **Amount**: e.g., $4.99
  - **Note**: e.g., `USER123-500` (auto-generated: username prefix + coin count)
- User copies CashApp address and note
- User confirms: "Done - I'll Complete Payment"
- Order created in `manual_coin_orders` table with status `pending`
- Modal closes with success toast

### 3. User Sends Cash App Payment
- User opens Cash App app
- Sends ${amount} to **$trollcity95**
- Includes reference **note** in payment message
- System admin (@trollcity95 owner) receives the payment

## Admin/Secretary Workflow

### 4. Secretary Reviews Order (Optional)
- Secretary can view pending orders in Admin Dashboard → **Manual Orders** tab
- Secretary can:
  - View user details (username, email, profile)
  - See order amount & coin count
  - See the suggested note/reference
  - Add notes or comments
  - Forward request to Admin with verification message

### 5. Admin Verifies & Approves
- Admin checks Cash App $trollcity95 account
- Verifies payment was received with matching note
- Goes to Admin Dashboard → **Manual Orders** tab
- Finds the pending order
- **Optional**: Enters external transaction ID (Cash App TX reference)
- Clicks **"Mark Paid & Credit"** button

### 6. System Processes Approval
1. Order status changes from `pending` → `paid` → `fulfilled`
2. User's `troll_coins` balance incremented
3. Transaction logged in coin transaction table
4. Admin dashboard updated with new balances
5. User receives notification (future: email/in-app alert)

## Components

### CashAppPaymentModal.tsx

- Shows user-friendly messaging

### CoinStoreModal.tsx (updated)

## Security Features

1. **RLS Policies**: Users can only see/create their own orders
2. **Role-Based Access**: Only admin/secretary can approve
3. **Authentication**: All endpoints require valid JWT token
4. **CORS**: Properly configured with status 200 for preflight
5. **Idempotency**: Order approval includes state checks

## Future Enhancements

- [ ] Automatic notifications to user when order fulfilled
- [ ] Email confirmation for Cash App payments
- [ ] Secretary → Admin forwarding workflow
- [ ] Payment expiration (auto-cancel if unpaid after 24h)
- [ ] Refund mechanism for disputed payments
- [ ] Webhook integration with Cash App API (if available)
- [ ] Duplicate payment detection
- [ ] Rate limiting to prevent abuse

## Troubleshooting

### CORS Error: "Response to preflight request doesn't pass access control check"
**Solution**: Ensure Edge Function returns status 200 for OPTIONS requests with proper CORS headers.

### Order not appearing after creation
**Verify**:
- RLS policy allows user to insert into `manual_coin_orders`
- Authentication token is valid
- User ID is correctly passed

### Coins not granted after approval
**Check**:
- Order status is `fulfilled` in database
- `troll_coins` field was actually incremented
- Transaction log entry was created
- User refreshed profile

### Admin cannot see orders
**Verify**:
- User role is `admin` or `secretary`
- RLS policy `admin_or_secretary_select_manual_orders` exists and is enabled
- Token includes correct role in JWT claims
