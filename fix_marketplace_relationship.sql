-- Fix Marketplace Foreign Key Relationship
-- Add foreign key relationship between trollcity_shops and shop_items tables

-- First, ensure the shop_items table has the correct structure
-- (This assumes shop_items table already exists with shop_id column)

-- Add foreign key constraint if it doesn't exist
